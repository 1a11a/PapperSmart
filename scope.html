              <p>Sri Lanka's economy heavily relies on agriculture, accounting for 45.46% of the nation's total land
                area in 2020. The World Bank's statistics on agricultural land in March 2023 provide current,
                historical, projections, and predictions.

                30% of Sri Lankans work in the agricultural sector, despite the tropical nation's potential for crop
                growth. However, productivity and profitability issues hinder the sector's growth.

                To assist bell pepper growers in increasing crop yields and lowering losses, the PepperSmart programme
                employs a smart polytunnel technology. It employs machine learning to enable early identification and
                treatment of powdery mildew diseases via a smartphone application.

                Powdery mildew susceptibility rises with age in bell pepper plants, with older plants and mature lower
                leaves exhibiting the earliest signs. Live host plant tissue is necessary for the fungus' development
                and survival. Fluffy white dots on the underbelly that might eventually become brown are early
                indications. By putting the leaf up to the light and keeping an eye on the mildew colonies, you may
                quickly identify early powdery mildew infections.

                This research led to the creation of a smart polytunnel system that can detect and assess plant powdery
                mildew disease in its early stages. With the use of this technology, crop yields and quality may be
                improved, increasing sustainability and profitability. The method helps ensure that bell pepper
                producers and the agricultural industry have a more secure and prosperous future by enabling proactive
                and well-informed crop management decisions.

            <h2 class="heading">Literature Survey</h2>
            <p>Computer vision technology aids in identifying plant infection by capturing images and detecting pests
              and diseases, replacing outdated methods in agriculture(4). Plant infection, which are caused by elements
              like temperature, bacteria, and surrounding crops and manifest early through physical changes in plants,
              interrupt important processes and are harmful to their health(5)(6).Plant diseases have an effect on plant
              development and food supply(6). Research studies use a variety of techniques to discover plant diseases,
              influencing development and identifying variables affecting plant growth. In academic studies, plant
              diseases are identified and categorised using feature extraction, image processing, and SVM classifiers.
              These articles also address the issue of unbalanced data and investigate transfer learning methodologies
              for edge computing solutions(6)(7).

              A computer vision system that detects plant illnesses has a 93% accuracy rate and an average F1 score of
              0.93. This strategy is computationally efficient and more precise than alternative approaches because it
              makes use of statistical image processing and machine learning models. For experts in vegetable pathology
              and pattern recognition, this article offers a thorough introduction(8)(9). Deep learning was used by
              researchers in 2021 to better diagnose plant diseases using a variety of ML techniques.(10). For the
              analysis and detection of plant leaf diseases, K.M. Mamatha, Seema Sing, and S.A. Hariprasad presented a
              convolutional neural network. The network examines pictures using a variety of strategies, concentrating
              on the leaves that are most susceptible to strain. Leaf samples are used as the dataset. For reliable
              results, pre-processed characteristics are used(11). A CNN method for diagnosing plant diseases using
              image processing was created by Sinha and Shekhawat in 2020. To detect NLB lesions in cropped photos, they
              developed a heat map and trained several CNNs(12). Four deep learning models that were trained on plant
              leaves fared better than earlier techniques in terms of accuracy and loss while identifying plant
              diseases(13). Sri Lanka's agriculture sector is essential for generating employment and ensuring food
              security. Secure bioconditions are necessary for the growth of healthy plants and the avoidance of disease
              in crops cultivated in polytunnels(14). Farmers depend on the leaf area index, but hand counting is
              time-consuming and challenging, hence automated technological alternatives are being investigated(15).
              Accurate ecophysiological evaluations and gas exchange in mid-latitude forests and shrublands need leaf
              tissue area (LAI). Polytunnels offer crop protection, however it might be difficult to maintain a secure
              bio environment. Automation for assessing plant health and boosting output is made possible by robotics,
              sensors, and AI technology. These instruments support problem-solving, damage minimization, and crop
              health surveillance. Robots using cameras can classify weeds, use less pesticides, and keep an eye on the
              health of crops to stop the spread of disease. The digital agricultural revolution has transformed farming
              practises, boosting output and having positive effects on the environment.

              Modern tools like sensors, GPS monitoring, and drones allow farmers to get real-time data on weather
              patterns, soil moisture, and crop growth rates. This Information enhances insect control, fertilisation,
              and irrigation, increasing crop yields and profitability. Efficiency and innovation are fostered by
              digitalization, which is fueled by trends like IoT and precision agriculture(16). In recent years, a
              number of venues for knowledge exchange have appeared. Information sharing platforms have advanced
              significantly as a new type of sharing economy, giving users additional avenues for Information
              acquisition, knowledge sharing, and personal knowledge storage. However, there are still issues with
              knowledge sharing platforms, such as inconsistent product quality (Content quality) and bad user
              experience(17). By encouraging Information exchange and agricultural innovation among farmers,
              professionals, academics, lawmakers, and consumers, social media helps to break down regional barriers and
              strengthen global connectivity. The most recent research has made progress in using computer vision to
              detect plant diseases. On the other hand, there is an enormous deficit in knowledge about the early
              diagnosis of powdery mildew in bell pepper crops by detecting the stressed level. While several research
              have looked into disease identification using deep learning and image processing, little focus has been
              placed on the unique difficulties posed by powdery mildew in bell pepper plants. By creating and
              evaluating the "PepperSmart" smart polytunnel system, which is particularly designed for the prompt
              detection and treatment of powdery mildew in bell pepper farming by recording the stressed level of the
              leaf, the current study aims to close this discrepancy. This targeted effort has the potential to promote
              sustainable farming methods inside Sri Lanka's crucial agriculture industry.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Research Gap</h2>
            <p>
              A significant body of research has explored various aspects of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants,
              including epidemiology, symptomatology, and treatment. However, several research gaps still exist,
              particularly regarding the use of advanced image analysis methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks
              (CNN), Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8, to assess the degree of illness and the application of agrochemicals in
              bell pepper plants. While these deep learning techniques have shown promise in identifying and measuring
              plant diseases in other crops, there's a lack of comprehensive evaluation of their efficacy in bell pepper
              plants. Additionally, AI models and mobile apps have been developed to automate powdery mildew detection
              in bell pepper plants. This research highlights the potential of using CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8 for
              assessing the severity of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants based on lesion patterns in photos. The
              proposed solution includes the development of a mobile application to enhance accessibility. Furthermore,
              it mentions "Smart Pepper's" API access, which allows other parties to interact with the services. The
              research emphasizes the importance of accurate methods in training the algorithm and suggests a pro
              version of the solution for achieving the highest accuracy. The lack of early detection of powdery mildew
              in bell pepper plants by first assessing plant stress is identified as a research gap. The paper also
              compares this work with other research papers in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional image
              processing and machine learning techniques to deep learning methods for plant disease and pest detection.
              Several studies using deep learning techniques, including CNN, InceptionV3, InceptionResnetV2,
              MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and SVM, have been cited for identifying various plant diseases and pests in
              different crops, demonstrating the versatility of deep learning in this context. Two additional studies
              outside the powdery mildew context focus on robotics, machine learning, and computer vision for plant
              monitoring in polytunnels. The first paper discusses the use of robotics and machine learning for disease
              identification and treatment in polytunnels using thermal imaging, while the second paper emphasizes
              estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of maize plants in polytunnels with machine learning and computer
              vision techniques.

            <h2 class="heading">Research Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Early detection of plant infection is essential for ensuring healthy plant development and, eventually,
              for boosting agricultural output and food production. The risk of agricultural failure and loss can be
              reduced by early discovery of plant illnesses, which can stop the disease from spreading to other plants
              in the same area or adjacent fields. Furthermore, early discovery can reduce the need for pricey and
              possibly dangerous chemical treatments, like pesticides and fungicides, which can have detrimental effects
              on the ecosystem and human health.
              Farmers and researchers can better understand the root causes of plant diseases and create efficient
              management strategies to stop future outbreaks by spotting them in the early phases. This could involve
              cultivating products that are immune to disease, enhancing soil management techniques, and using
              pesticides and other remedies more effectively and strategically.

            <h2 class="heading">Research Objective</h2>
            <p>The main objective of this research is to develop a mobile app with a function that will aid bell pepper
              growers in the early detection of "powdery mildew" infection. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that
              affects many crops, including bell peppers, and can cause significant damage to the crop if left
              untreated. Therefore, this application will become a great help for bell pepper farmers to identify the
              disease during the early stage and this application will suggest suitable medications also.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of the mobile application is to assist farmers in detecting powdery mildew early on so they
              can respond quickly and stop the infection from infecting additional plants. The application may make use
              of image processing and object detection technologies to find the powdery mildew's distinctive signs.
            </p>
            <p>
              A mobile application might help farmers save time and money by decreasing the need for costly and toxic
              pesticides by spotting powdery mildew early. The software may also assist farmers in increasing production
              and growing healthier crops, which would result in higher profitability and a more sustainable
              agricultural sector.

            <p>The “PepperSmart” mobile application system is developed using 4 major components which are, </p>

            <ul>
              PepperSmart is a smart polytunnel application designed
              for bell pepper farmers, offering disease detection, severity
              detection, plant leaf area index detection, and post shearing
              and commenting. It detects powdery mildew disease and rec-
              ommends suitable medications for infected plants, enhancing
              yield and cost. This application is crucial for preventing
              powdery mildew and improving the overall quality of bell
              pepper plants. <br>

              An infrared camera can identify the presence of powdery
              mildew by detecting stressed temperature. For early detection,
              high-resolution photos are essential. The software analyses
              each plant individually to measure stress levels and leaf
              area indices. The tool establishes a platform for Information
              exchange and use Auto ML to identify bell pepper plants that
              are disease-infected. The objective is to build a robot that can
              measure temperature and take pictures in order to diagnose
              and cure the illness. <br>

              This research is proposed as a smart solution to the main
              four problems identified in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka.
              Once the application is developed, it will be introduced to bell
              pepper farmers, industry experts, and researchers to use it in
              their affairs. This application will be a great help to bell pepper
              farmers to maximize the crop yield and the income they get. <br>

              (1) Using temperature data to determine the degree of leaf
              stress.
              <br>
              (2) Using image classification to distinguish between healthy
              and sick bell pepper leaves.<br>

              Readings of the leaf temperature are gathered, and stress
              levels are calculated using a predefined threshold. To classify
              leaves into healthy and unhealthy categories, machine learning
              or deep learning models are applied. Combining these method-
              ologies enables a thorough evaluation of plant health and the
              creation of powdery mildew infection management strategies.
              <br>

              <br>deep learning models were trained using temperature
              data and photos of bell pepper leaves. An extensive collection
              of leaf photos was captured with a high-resolution camera. The
              temperature of the bell pepper plants and their surroundings
              were continually measured using a thermal model.
              By examining temperature data, the study focuses on deter-
              mining the stress levels in bell pepper leaves. To measure stress
              levels, the researchers utilised a preset threshold or algorithm.
              The photographs were shot in a polytunnel, which controlled
              the development of bell peppers at various phases. The photos
              were carefully chosen to capture the leaves precisely, and
              using image classification, stressed and healthy leaves were
              distinguished.
              <br>

              Photographs of bell pepper leaves are manually annotated
              by plant health specialists to look for symptoms of stress
              and the disease powdery mildew. Machine learning algorithms
              or deep learning models are used to categorise leaves into
              groups that are healthy or powdery mildew-infected, image
              classification algorithms discern between healthy and diseased
              leaves. The first test focused on disease diagnosis and the
              second on identifying physiological stress. Combining these
              approaches offers a thorough assessment of bell pepper plant
              health, assisting in efficient management strategies.
              <br>
              By examining temperature data, the study focuses on determin-
              ing the stress levels in bell pepper leaves. To measure stress
              levels, the researchers utilised a preset threshold or algorithm.
              Various stages of bell pepper growth were regulated in the
              polytunnel. The photos were carefully chosen to capture the
              leaves and using image classification, stressed and healthy
              leaves were distinguished.
              The study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) archi-
              tecture to analyse the photos and categorise powdery mildew
              infection using TensorFlow, a machine learning framework.
              This technique made it easier to recognise stressed leaves and
              determine the degree of powdery mildew occurrence, which
              helped with a thorough evaluation of plant health.
              <br><br>
              <h5>B. Severity Calculation of infected bell pepper Leaves</h5>
              <br>
              The recommended method outlines an organised approach
              for assessing the severity of powdery mildew on bell pepper
              plants. The association between infection levels and yield
              loss is explored after a detailed analysis of the background
              Information, with an emphasis on the need of early detection.
              A detailed analysis of sickness symptoms and their repercus-
              sions emphasises the need of employing effective treatment
              methods.
              <br>
              The method then moves on to state-of-the-art technolog-
              ical choices, including TensorFlow and OpenCV-based AI-
              accelerated technologies that enable accurate severity analysis
              and pesticide optimisation. This serves as the foundation for
              the severity calculation approach, which is developed utilising
              methods like colour segmentation.
              <br>
              Automated chemical administration and disease progression
              assessment are crucial for accurate disease management. A
              smartphone app called ”Smart Poly Tunnel Helpful Guide”
              uses image recognition and model integration for real-time
              evaluation, interactive maps, and educational content. The
              strategy prioritizes user feedback and offers economic and
              ecological benefits, highlighting the potential for affordable
              chemical uses beyond agriculture.
              <br>
              As a result, this thorough methodology provides a compre-
              hensive approach that integrates user involvement, technolog-
              ical innovation, and economic factors to provide a dependable
              answer for estimating the severity of powdery mildew in
              bell pepper plants while laying the foundation for upcoming
              improvements and advancements.

              <h5>C. Creating a Knowledge Sharing Platform using Posts</h5>
              <br>Develop a user interface
              that allows users to compose and format text posts. Use rich
              text editors to enable text formatting and media embedding.
              Implement the functionality to upload images along with posts,
              enabling users to share visual content
              <br>Allow users to add relevant
              tags to their posts. Use dropdowns or text inputs for tag entry.
              Create a system that categorizes posts based on user-assigned
              tags, making it easier for users to find and discover content.
              <br> Design an admin panel that allows moder-
              ators to review and approve posts before they become publicly
              visible. Implement automated content moderation algorithms
              to detect and flag inappropriate content, helping maintain a
              positive community environment. <br><br>

              <h5>D. Calculating the Leaf Area Index</h5>
              <br>Implement image processing techniques
              within the simulation to mimic real-world leaf detection.
              Apply color-based segmentation methods to identify leaves
              from the background.
              <br>Calculate the leaf area by sum-
              ming the areas of all detected leaf segments, considering the
              scale and resolution of the simulation.
              <br>Overlay the detected leaf segments on the
              simulation, showing users where the System has identified
              leaves.
              Provide a dynamic display of the calculated Leaf Area
              Index (LAI) as the simulation progresses, allowing users to
              see changes in real time.
              <br>
              This study offers the bell pepper producers a rare chance to
              address their issues while maximizing their yields and revenue
